    tagline:
      "One of the heaviest and hardest commercial hardwoods in the world, widely used for marine and heavy civil structures.",
    densityBadge: "1,050 - 1,150 kg/m³",
    durabilityBadge: "Class 1 · Very Durable",

    realImage: "/images/1453b-1.jpg",
    generalCharacteristics:
      "Azobé is a very dense, extremely hard West and Central African hardwood. It is valued where supreme mechanical strength, wear resistance, and long service life in severely exposed marine and hydraulic conditions are the priority, rather than appearance or ease of machining.",
    appearance:
      "Heartwood is dark red-brown to deep chocolate violet-brown, often speckled with conspicuous white or light yellow mineral deposits in the pores. Clearly distinct from the paler, narrow sapwood. The grain is heavily interlocked and the texture is coarse and fibrous.",
    density:
      "Air-dry density is commonly cited at roughly 1,000–1,100 kg/m³ (green density reaches 1,200–1,300 kg/m³), which means Azobé sinks in water. Expect heavy loads per cubic metre; container weight limits (typically 21–25 tonnes) are usually reached before container volume.",
    durability:
      "Generally classed as Natural Durability Class 1 (Very Durable), with extraordinary natural resistance to fungal decay and marine borers (teredo) in exposed coastal waters. Outstanding performance depends on proper application and strictly excluding sapwood.",
    typicalApplications:
      "Harbour lock gates, marine jetties, fender piles, sheet piling, heavy railway sleepers, coastal bridge trusses, heavy industrial flooring, crane outrigger mats, and other demanding civil engineering works.",
    sawnTimberConsiderations:
      "Its extreme density makes sawing slow and blunts tools rapidly; stellite-tipped saws and reduced feed rates are essential. Drying is slow and must be carefully controlled under covered shade to limit checking, end splits, and distortion. Heavy beam sections are a standard sawn specification.",
    logSupplyConsiderations:
      "Logs can be very large and heavy (60cm to 120cm+ diameter). Buyers should agree diameter classes, length specifications (4.0m to 11.5m), and confirm port loading methods because highway axle-load and container weight limits are reached before cubic capacity.",
    buyerConsiderations:
      "State the end use, required section sizes, and dimensional tolerances (typically ±2mm on heavy sections). For marine and civil structural work, confirm any grading criteria (e.g. D70 strength class EN 338) or phytosanitary requirements in your destination market before ordering.",

      "Freshly sawn heartwood displays warm yellow-orange to reddish-brown tones, darkening upon atmospheric exposure to a rich, luminous russet-brown. Sapwood is narrow (2–5cm), pale greyish-yellow, and clearly differentiated. Grain is irregular and heavily interlocked with a coarse texture.",
    density:
      "Air-dry density averages 900 to 1,000 kg/m³ at 12% moisture content (green density approximately 1,100 kg/m³). Dense enough to resist heavy foot and vehicular traffic without mechanical indentation. Container payloads average 20–22 m³ per 20ft box.",
    durability:
      "Class 1 (Very Durable). Excellent natural resistance to wood-rotting fungi, dry wood insects, and marine borers in temperate waters. Proven track record in humid outdoor environments with permanent ground or freshwater contact.",
    typicalApplications:
      "Heavy outdoor decking, coastal boardwalks, footbridges, railway sleepers, hydraulic revetments, industrial warehouse flooring, garden pergolas, sound barriers, and marine wharf construction.",
    sawnTimberConsiderations:
      "Requires carbide or stellite tooling due to hardness and trace silica content. Pre-drilling is required for all screws and bolts. Air seasoning should proceed under cover; dries slowly with a moderate tendency to surface checking if exposed to direct tropical sun.",
    logSupplyConsiderations:
      "Cylindrical, well-formed forest boles typically 65cm to 100cm+ in diameter. Straight trunks yield consistent volumes of long, clean structural planks and squared beams with minimal sapwood waste.",
    buyerConsiderations:
      "Specify whether heart-free (FOHC) or boxed-heart is acceptable. For decking contracts, specify pre-profiled grooving (anti-slip) or smooth four-sides-planed (S4S) requirements, along with target moisture condition (AD vs fresh-cut).",

    sawnTimberConsiderations:
      "Saws and planes cleanly with conventional high-speed tooling. A reduced cutting angle (15°–20°) prevents grain tear-out on quarter-sawn ribbon faces. Dries relatively quickly; kiln-drying to 10–12% moisture content is widely requested and highly stable.",
